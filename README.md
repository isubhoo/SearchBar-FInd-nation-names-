# SearchBar-FInd-nation-names-

# Output
This is a simple iOS application to Show Search Bar functionality. In this App, users can search for Country names from a list of over 200 country names. The app contains a table view that initially displays all country names. Users can type some keywords in the search bar to filter the list, once they stop typing after a 2-second table view updates to show only the countries that match the given keyword (to ensure unnecessary API calls).
